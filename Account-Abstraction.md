# Account Abstraction
**Account abstraction** is a concept that allows users to store their assets in smart contracts instead of traditional accounts that require a private key. In ZK Sync, this feature is built directly into the system, meaning it has native **account abstraction**.

**On Ethereum, there are two types of accounts**:

* *Externally owned accounts (EOAs)*: These are the traditional accounts that require a public and private key. Users need to sign and initiate their own transactions.
* *Contract accounts*: These are smart contracts that function like accounts but can do more complex tasks. They can have multiple signers, or let others pay for gas and send transactions on behalf of the user.

>🗒️ NOTE <br> On ZK Sync, every account is automatically a smart contract account. This means they can be customized with features like different types of signatures, multi-signature options, and spending limits.
