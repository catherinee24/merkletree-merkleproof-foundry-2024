EIP 712
EIP-712 is a standard that makes signing and reading structured data easier and more specific in Ethereum. Here’s how it works:

Data Format for Signing: When you sign data using EIP-712, it looks like this:

scss
Copiar código
0x19 0x01 <domainSeparator> <hashStruct(message)>
Parts of the Data:

0x19: A prefix that shows this data is for signing.
0x01: A version number that tells us which version of the standard is being used.
Domain Separator: Additional information that helps specify the context or domain for the data being signed.
hashStruct(message): The hashed version of the structured message you want to sign.
In simple terms, EIP-712 makes it easier to handle and verify structured messages by defining a clear format for signing them.
